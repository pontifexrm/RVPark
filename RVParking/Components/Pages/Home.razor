        @* As they say you cannot beat Wellington on a good day.<br /> *@
        @* If you are in an RV, Campervan etc.. and a ferry to catch.... WHAT A HASSLE...<br /> *@
        @* Finding a park overnight, really close to the terminal... THAT WOULD BE GOOD!<br /> *@
        @* Or a rest-up before setting out north.... YES THAT's GOOD TOO! *@
        Looking for a powered RV Park going to or from the Cook Strait Ferries in Wellington?<br />
